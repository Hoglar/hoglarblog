// What is this.

// We must have some suggestion, first only based on popularity. Then based on topic and popularity.
// The popularity part will get updated regularily so that we get some shifts in the picture.

// I gues we can have like six suggestions?
// We should have a separate container for this i think. not in read. Then we have different components for each sugg.

// Layout
// This box should be grid. we can the make 6 separate boxes.
// The separate suggestions should be grid to i guess, to make the layout easy.


// Database troubles
// We need to get two kind of data from database, one for all topics and one for specified topic.
// I want an array if the 6 most popular
// give documents to note, thats just better i guess.
    // We do one search at noteLaunch if topic is not present. then we do search at topic change.
    // guess we can use componentWillMount
    // And componentDidUpdate.

    // we should just search/ compare documents with some popularity, so we dont go through all crap that will pile up.
