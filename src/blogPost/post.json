I then wanted to use the array key as an url adress. There must be easyer ways to get the key but i got the key by using the indexOf method. To use the indexOf method you first have to select the array you want to get the index of a key in, then you have to use the method on it and give the parameter of the key name. array.indexOf(key), you then get the index back and your done."
