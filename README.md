# hoglarblog


Hello

The hoglarblog repo is where hoglar.com is getting created. Im a guy that is learning how to code on my free time and this project is kinda my practice area. I am very glad if someone wanna commit or just chat ! :)

Hoglar.com is made to be a helpfull learning platform. I want to make a simple page with some functionality. Right now i got 7 different apps i want to implement, some stand alone but in some way i think they all will talk together.

Notes When writing in notes, i should have some sort of functionality so i can mark a word, press a button and then it gives me a dictionary explanation.

Ideas

Social I will not make a chat or message function(maybe later). This is because other options are way better i think. And i want the social piece of the site to be something else. I have played a lot of videogames, and the best ones is those who make you feel part of a community or a world. Some big mmorpg doesnt get this, and make a huge world full of players but where you feel youre playing alone. I want to make a feeling that your learning together with other people. You kinda need to be dependent on others maybe ?

I want to explore meritocracy, how do we decide wich posts are good and which deserve deletion.

Questions I want a way to easly ask questions kinda out in the air.
One idea is to make the question api a part of notes (maybe also some of the others). When writing notes you can easly put down a question. when someone reads you notes they may get a good feeling of what your asking about since the question comes with a context. Then they can in the notes answer the question. This answer will then go to the users question section and the question api will light up.
